# Quaternion-rotation-in-Unity
Uses lerp!

`scr_tilt` is a file with basic rotation, following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGiCejM743g) by "Quick Tutorial" on YouTube.
`scr_tilt_extended` is my addition to this script, which adds a few extra's but focuses on rotating the object in `WSAD` directions, before a cououtine resets to its starting position.

Use `WSAD` keys to temporarily rotate object.
